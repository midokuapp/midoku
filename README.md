# Midoku App

## Development

I assume you have followed the [Getting Started](https://dioxuslabs.com/learn/0.6/getting_started/)
guide from Dioxus and have installed `dioxus-cli`.

### Run the app

### Android

See https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/#android for the prerequisites.

> [!NOTE]
> You will not need to install the `armv7-linux-androideabi` nor
> `i686-linux-android` targets as Wasmtime+Cranelift does not support arm32.
